OBTAINING THE SOFTWARE  

The Software (specifically, 2D MT anisotropic modeling) are   
available for non-commercial and academic use subject to the   
license agreement in the attached Copyright statement.   

Obtain the source code from https://github.com/Zeqiu/AnisoMT,   
or by command: git clone https://github.com/Zeqiu/AnisoMT.git

==================================================

INSTALLATION AND USAGE  

  This MATLAB package is programmed under object-oriented paradigm,   
  to install it, just include all the directories in MATLAB PATH.  
  
  To start, change to 'Test' directory to prepare model input  
  files and run the driver script. This is still an onging project,  
  and many pre-/post-processing routines should be added in the future.    

==================================================

BUG REPORTS AND FEATURE REQUESTS  

If you find a reproducible bug, please let us know. The authors will try to  
reproduce and eliminate the bug. Feature requests will be noted and possibly   
implemented sooner or later.
